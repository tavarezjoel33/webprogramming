CMP 464 - Web Programming (Fall 2019)

David Ashe - davidmashe@gmail.com, https://github.com/lehmanclass/webprogramming

In this course, you will practice your "fullstack" web application development skills by building four projects. These projects will be exactly the kind of sample apps you can use to demonstrate your programming ability to prospective employers. Money, amirite?

Required Materials: google, stackoverflow, your time & attention

Suggested Materials: codecademy.com, codepen.com, css-tricks.com, stackoverflow.com, google.com

Use Of Technology: You will need a computer. You will need git and node installed. I can help with this if you get really stuck.

Shaming Others For Ignorance: Everyone in this class knows some things about technology. Absolutely no one knows everything (including me). Shaming others for mistakes or lack of knowledge will not be tolerated in this class. Let's build each other up, instead.

Grading Policy:

Project One (Web Client only): 20%

Project Two (server only): 20%

Project Three (build app, use external API instead of database): 20%

Project Four (build fullstack app with database): 30%

Attendance: 10%

Attendance will be taken by sending an in-class token to my server via a curl command. 

Extra credit: see below

Grading Method:

Each project will have five clearly defined features that I will test via an automated tool. If all tests pass, you immediately earn a 90%. Every failed test is 10% off your grade (these tests will be very, very clearly defined up front)

The final 10% will be awarded if you do two of the following (5% if you do only one):

-You score 75% or above on an automated accessibility audit
-Your CSS styling is mobile-first
-Have a Pull Request in the github repo history (beyond the pull request you use to submit)
-Write five unit tests
-Write two integration tests
-Add CSS styling beyond what is required 
-Use a front-end framework other than what is mandated (instead of React, use Vue or angular, or use jQuery for project 1)
-Deploy your project to a live URL
-Your project solves a real person's problem (your git repo's README must describe how this is the case)
-Have 4 or more pages in your project (project 1 only)
-install & use eslint on your project
-use an external API & fetch to get data from it

If you do ALL of these, you get an extra 5% (thus you can get extra credit on every project).

Asking For Help:

This class tries to simulate a working software engineer environment. I love to answer questions and help students, but DO NOT ask for help before you've tried to help yourself. I reserve the right to ignore any question if you cannot describe TWO THINGS you have tried before seeking out my help.
