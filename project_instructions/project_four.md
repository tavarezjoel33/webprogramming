# Project Four

I want you to build a fullstack application that does something you've thought up, or copies an existing app's functionality (build a "lite" version of facebook, airbnb, )

Requirements:

- It uses a front end Single-Page Application framework like React.
- It has a server (express or something else for xtra credit) that serves the front end and exposes APi endpoints.
- it uses a postgres database to persist data (Use elephantSQL).
- You email me by 12/3 with your proposed app idea.
- I can launch your app by running: 
	`cd webprogramming/project_four`
	`npm i`
	`project_four/seed.js` (this will seed your database on a local postgres server)
	`project_four/index.js`
